What you have done in the assignment
	- Building TCP sockets between client and AWS server
	- Building UDP sockets between AWS server and three backend servers
	- Transmitting files from client to AWS, AWS then segments it into three
	parts and send to three backend servers to process them with the command 
	from client. Three backend servers send back the outcome to AWS, AWS send
	outcome to client after doing some computation.
  
What your code files are and what each one of them does. (Please do not
repeat the project description, just name your code files and briefly mention
what they do).
	- client.c: send nums file which is needed to be processed by given 
	command from client and receive outcome
	- aws.c: transmitting file from client, segment it into three "same size" 
	job to three backend servers. After receiving outcome from three servers,
	it does some simple computation and send final result to client
	- serverA.c serverB.c serverC.c: receive file from AWS, do computation to
	files and send outcome back to AWS.
  
Reused Code: Did you use code from anywhere for your project? If not, say
so. If so, say what functions and where they're from. (Also identify this with a
comment in the source code.)
	yes.
	1. Socket frame from Beej guide
	(http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/singlepage/bgnet.html)
	I used code from this website to build the frame of my all socket. Basically,
	all socket related function I knew till now are from here. Building socket,
	bind socket, connect, send/sendto, recv/recvfrom.
	2. Read file in c
	(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3463426/in-c-how-should-i-read-a-text-file-and-print-all-strings)
	Function of reading file is from this source. I modified it to adapt request
	of this project.
